## Points Hook

1. When a user gets referred, we will mint a hardcoded amount of POINTS token to the referrer - in our case, 500 POINTS

2. When a swap takes place which buys TOKEN for ETH - we will issue POINTS equivalent to how much ETH was swapped in to the user, and 10% of that amount to the referrer (if any).

3. When someone adds liquidity, we will issue POINTS equivalent to how much ETH they added, and 10% of that amount to the referrer (if any).
